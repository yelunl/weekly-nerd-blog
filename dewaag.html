                    <h2>Summary of De Waag</h2>

                    <p>
                        De Waag talked about different layers in what the user
                        sees on their phones and what the reality is in what is
                        underneath. There is a lot underneath like the stack,
                        design process and fundament.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Next thing they talked about is mobile apps and the
                        privacy of it. They asked question about how important
                        privacy is for us and if we ever think about it. They
                        gave us a few exercises where we express how important
                        privacy is to us and describe our ideal phones.

                    <h2>Conclusion: what I learned</h2>
                    <p>
                        Privacy is not something i want to worry about too much,
                        because i really believe my data is probably already out
                        there. Even if i try to do my best to keep my own data
                        save i believe it can never be 100% save as long i'm
                        online. I have turned on my 2fa on practically every
                        account i own but by the end of the day the companies
                        that hold my data are they ones responsible for keeping
                        my data save. And they don't always do a very good job
                        at it. I've been in a few data breaches where my data
                        got leaked and there is nothing i can do about it. I do
                        believe that companies need to take privacy more
                        seriously and that if they ask for your data they have to
                        take the responsibility that comes with it.
