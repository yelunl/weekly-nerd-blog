          <p>
            During the next 20 weeks of this minor, I want to focus on getting
            better with basic Html Css and Javascript. I want to learn what else
            is possible with these languages and discover new possibilities on
            using them. Previously I already did other minors focussed on tech
            and used a lot of Javascript and a framework. Now I want to let go
            of these (very) advanced things and focus on vanilla JS, CSS, HTML.
            I want to learn to use proper html tags, write vanilla JS and
            explore what else is possible using CSS and find different challenges.
