          <h2>Summary of Jeremy's lecture</h2>

          <p>
            Today's lecture Jeremy talked about imperative and declarative
            programming. Html and Css are declarative languages. It focuses on
            what needs to be done without going in to the details on HOW it
            needs to do it. It lets the browser take control on how to implement
            it. Html and Css provide structure and styling instructions to the
            browser, making it declarative. On the other hand we have imperative
            programming like Javascript. Which means you give detailed
            instructions to the browser which also means you have more control
            but potentially can lead to more errors. It is better to minimize
            the amount of Javascript and use Html and Css when possible because
            the browser has it's own built-in error handling.

          <h2>Conclusion: what I learned</h2>
          <p>
            Just like a few speakers before, it's best to use Html and Css as
            much as possible instead of Javascript. It's built-in to the browser
            and provide some good error handling. The browser has it's own way
            doing certain things which can also save a lot of time compared to
            doing everything yourself with javascript where you must providing detailed
            instructions.
