            Marieke de Hoop (ex-cmd'er) and Tim Teuwisse are both working for
            the company Digitaal Toegankelijk. Here they test website of other
            companies and measure how much they are accessible. They give advice
            on how to make their sites more accessible.

          <h2>Summary of Digitaal Toegankelijk</h2>
          <blockquote>
            The big 4: Perceivable, operable, understandable and robust.
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            Today talk was all about web accessibility. They talked about the
            big 4 of the WCAG:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <h3>Perceivable</h3>
              <p>Can this content be viewed by anyone?</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Operable</h3>
              <p>Can this content be reached and used by everyone?</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Understandable</h3>
              <p>Can this content be understood by everyone?</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Robust</h3>
              <p>
                Is the technology behind my digital product semantically
                correct?
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            These are the main standards of creating an accessible website
            according to WCAG. And they should be tested on these 4 points.
            According to them there are a few criteria that help to get all 4
            points.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <h3>1.4.2 - Audio Control</h3>
              <p>
                If the sound takes longer than 3 seconds, there must be an
                option to pause/stop it or reduce the volume.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>2.1.2 - No keyboard traps</h3>
              <p>
                When you navigate with the keyboard, it should not happen that
                you can no longer navigate out of an element or part of the
                website.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>2.2.2 - Pause, stop, hide</h3>
              <p>
                All moving, flashing, scrolling or updating elements that: start
                automatically, last longer than 5 seconds and is shown parallel
                to other content must be able to paused, stopped or hidden.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>2.3.2 - Three flashes or below threshold</h3>
              <p>
                On web pages no element should flash 3 or more times in a
                second.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Another advice they would give is on how to test our own website for
            accessibility:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <h3>Use a screen reader</h3>
              <p>
                This way we can we certain that our site it accessible for
                people with screen readers.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Navigate your site with a keyboard (without a mouse)</h3>
              <p>
                To make sure there are not keyboard traps, you can use the tab
                key to navigate through a website.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Test with the target audience</h3>
              <p>They do really want to help you</p>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Conclusion: what I learned</h2>
          <p>
            The importance of accessibility of a website is becoming more and
            more important. There is a law in the EU that says that by 2025 all
            websites must be accessible for everyone and if they are not there
            could be a fine given to companies. Other things I learned are the
            Big 4 and advice on how to reach those criteria and making my own
            websites accessible.
