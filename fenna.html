              <h3>focus state</h3>
              <p>
                always add a focus state for users that use your site with a
                keyboard by tabbing. Use the :focus-visible instead of :focus.
                One can als create a custom focus state for certain elements.
                Use a special class for these elements
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Aria-label</h3>
              <p>
                Gives a descriptive text about an element. Mostly used on
                elements that don't provide enough context
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Aria-expanded</h3>
              <p>
                Gives the state of an element wether its expanded or not. Like a
                menu, accordion, dropdown etc. It is either 'true' or 'false'
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Aria-live</h3>
              <p>
                Reads dynamic changes made to the page. It has 3 values: off
                (default), polite(waits then reads), assertive(immediately reads
                the changes, even when screen reader is busy)
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Aria-atomic</h3>
              <p>
                Paired together with the aria-live. true(read the entire changed
                sections), false(reads only the changed nodes).
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Carousels</h3>
              <p>
                Carousels must have the role="region" or the semantic section
                element. It also needs aria-roledescription="carousel" and
                aria-labelledby or aria-label.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Carousels slider</h3>
              <p>
                The carousel slider must have role="group" and
                aria-roledescription="slide" and aria-labelledby or aria-label
                to tell what slide you are on. for example: 1 of 3.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Carousels hide invisible slides</h3>
              <p>
                When a slider is not visible on the screen, it must be hidden by
                the screen reader. Use aria-hidden="true" on the wrapper and
                tabindex="-1" on all the children that are focusable.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Carousels avoid lists</h3>
              <p>
                Avoid using li elements. It won't inform users about the current
                li-item or when going inside/outside the element. When using li
                it also tells you how many list items there are in total,
                including the hidden ones.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Carousels controls</h3>
              <p>
                The carousel controls must have the role="group". And it must
                have aria-label to tell what the controls do. The control that
                shows the current slide must have the aria-disabled="true".
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Focus guards</h3>
              <p>
                Focus guards helps to navigate a site while putting focus on
                certain elements on top without accidentally navigating to the
                background. This helps to give the user good tab navigation
                without getting disoriented.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Dialog element</h3>
              <p>
                Dialog creates this focusable overlay where the user can't tab
                outside of the element.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Color contrast</h3>
              <p>
                Color contrast can vary between 1 and 21. According to the WCAG
                guidelines, the contrast of text with it's background must be
                4,5:1. Big text 24px or 18px bold and important icons must have
                a contrast of 3:1. Logo's and decorative text are excluded.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Lighthouse audit</h3>
              <p>
                To test your site for contrast, you can test it with the
                Lighthouse audit and find out what elements have low contrasts.
                You can also use the dev tools to see the contrast along with
                other accessibility features.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Minimal fontsize of 16px</h3>
              <p>
                To make text readable site must have a minimal fontsize of 16px.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>line length of 50 - 75 characters</h3>
              <p>
                the optimal line length is between 50 - 75 characters. That also
                includes spaces. It makes it more comfortable to read one line
                after another and prevents people from getting lost. On bigger
                screen sizes like desktop, you must add a max-width to prevent
                to get long lines of text. You can use the ch unit in css, 1 ch
                is the width of the 0 character.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>alt text on images</h3>
              <p>
                You must use alt text on images for people who can not see the
                images. The alt text gives a short description on what can be
                seen on the image. Don't start an alt text with 'a picture
                of...'
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Semantic HTML</h3>
              <p>
                Using semantic HTML helps to structure the content better in a
                meaningful way for screen reader users and it prevents using too
                many aria-attributes. The website can also be found much easier
                in search engines.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Extra accessibility tips</h3>
              <p>
                If you want to add some extra accessibility to your site
                consider the following: skip to content button,
                prefers-reduced-motion, all autoplay videos/carousels must be
                able to get paused and use a screen reader yourself. 
              </p>

          <h2>What I learned</h2>
          <p>
            Things i learned is to make websites accessible and how to do that.
            We got introduced to using common ARIA attributes to make a website
            more screen reader accessible. There were many things said that were
            new to me, so it was certainly a very interesting lecture.
