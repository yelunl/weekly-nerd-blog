          <h2>Summary of Fenna's lecture</h2>
          <p>
            Today's lecture we have a guest called Fenna de Wilde. She is a
            creative developer at Bakken & BÃ¦ck. She talked about how to make a
            website accessible using different techniques she learned at
            Phantom and things she would have done differently to make the site
            accessible. She gave us a list of different techniques to use to
            make a website accessible.

          <h2>What I learned</h2>
          <p>
            Things i learned is to make websites accessible and how to do that.
            We got introduced to using common ARIA attributes to make a website
            more screenreader accessible. There were many things said that were
            new to me, so it was certainly a very interesting lecture.
