      <h2>What I learned</h2>
      <p>
        Things i learned is to make websites accessible and how to do that. We
        got introduced to using common ARIA attributes to make a website more
        screenreader accessible. There were many things said that were new to
        me, so it was certainly a very interesting lecture.
