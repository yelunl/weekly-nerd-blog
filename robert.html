                    <h3>Us</h3>

                        or something else. Then he continues talking about WHAT
                        you want to do. Write code all day, talk with
                        clients/stakeholders, Do (user) research, experiment
                        with new tech, manage stuff or do something totally
                        different. HOW and WHERE to get this job: stay at your
                        internship, go for job hunt, find yourself somewhere
                        exotic, continue studying, traineeship or have no clue.
                        Each of these have different advantages and
                        disadvantages. Robert has asked different CMD alumni
                        about there current jobs and how much money they earn.
                        They all do different things and earn between 2000 and
                        3000 euro's. He gave as advice learn the fundamentals,
                        to always remain curious, stay informed and enjoy
                        discovering. It's best to ask each other to make better
                        decisions. You can learn everything once you know the
                        basics. You can decide to work at different places and
                        they all have their own advantages and disadvantages. But
                        the important thing is that you always talk to each other
                        about these things.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Money vs benefits</h3>
                    <p>
                        There is money and there are benefits. You have to
                        weight them together to find a good balance. part-time
                        you have to get the bruto and multiply by 0.8. Another
                        important thing is you should calculate how much your
                        own spendings are each month. That way you have a better
                        estimate on how much money you need to ask for. The
                        money should be realistic and the expectations for a
                        junior too.
