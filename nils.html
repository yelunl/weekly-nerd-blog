          <p>
            Nils is a designer and part-time developer. He creates really nice
            Css code. As a designer he learned css to get better control over
            the design.

          <h2>Summary of Nils's lecture</h2>
          <p>
            Today's lecture is was all about using CSS. Nils talked about his
            experience working in a team where developers tend to not really
            know about css and rather choose to use a library like Tailwind and
            bootstrap. These tend to be very limiting when it comes to design.
            Many times he was being said, that a design wasn't possible but
            reality is was by using pure css and going deeper in css features.
            Because of this he decided to learn css himself. Now he tends to
            make the css in his project and the developers now do other things.
            During the rest of the lecture he talk about having his own way of
            designing by letting go of the standard grid system. He showed a few
            example on how he uses grid in his project. He told us there are
            many new css units created and most of them are relative to the
            viewport.

          <h2>Conclusion: what I learned</h2>
          <p>
            Letting go of the standard grid may help in creating some really
            cool designs. Although personally i'm really bad at design. letting
            go if the standard grid sound a bit risky for me. For now i rather
            stick to the standard grid, once comfortable then try out different
            things with it. getting comfortable with Css sound also really
            important. Css does have many features and many things that are possible
            with it. I would like to know more of what's possible with css.
