          <p>
            Rosa is ex-cmd'er. She is a creative developer and has worked at
            different companies and now also has her own company called
            Vitrinekast. She's going to talk about creative ways to develop
            going beyond a website and her hobby called circuit bending.

          <h2>Summary of Rosa's lecture</h2>
          <p>
            Today's lecture was all about circuit bending. It's something born
            in the 70's where people take a random circuit from an electronic
            device. They 'bend' the device till some strange sound comes out of
            if. Anyone can start doing it. You do not need a lot of experience
            to start. A few tips she gave: Use battery only devices, look for
            ways to short circuit the board and create a form of interaction
            with the board. lastly she gave a few tips about finding a good
            environment where you can join groups in different cities.

          <h2>Conclusion: what I learned</h2>
          <p>
            There are many creative ways to think about tech. One of them is
            circuit bending, which i never heard of before. It sound
            interesting. But i don't think it's for me.
