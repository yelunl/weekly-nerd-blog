          <h2>About Jeffrey Arts</h2>
          <img src="./images/jeffrey.jpeg" alt="headshot of Jeffrey Arts" />
          <p>
            Jeffrey is developer and creative artist. He makes projects where he
            combines his interests in art with code and realized online and
            offline creative projects.

          <h2>Summary of Jeffrey's lecture</h2>
          <p>
            Jeffrey talked about the way he makes a couple about his projects.
            He uses something called a toolbox where he created different types
            of tools to make certain pieces faster. He talked about how he
            created the site <span lang="nl">'de waarde van perceptie.'</span> And how he created
            something called a 'covid star'. Something notable is he creates his
            design with code and sometimes turns those design into something
            physical. Like the 700 pieces of art he made after he codes them
            online or the concrete art pieces he makes. At the end he said to
            always experiment around and either fail or succeed and always learn
            from them.

          <h2>Conclusion: what I learned</h2>
          <p>
            It's possible to turn your online designs/code into something
            physical. Which is an interesting way of creativity that I had not
            seen before. Personally i'm not THAT creative to be able to that
            myself. So I will stick to just websites. The websites he made are
            very advanced and interactive. Which is fun to go through. I would
            love to add more interactivity to my own projects and explore the
            possibilities of that.
