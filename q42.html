                    <h2>Summary of Q42</h2>

                    <p>
                        During this lecture Q42 talked about how they keep
                        accessibility in mind when designing products. They
                        showed us a graph and turned it into sound. You could
                        here the way the graph goes. another project was about a
                        very interactive site they created for a museum. The
                        site was very animated because the client wanted a site
                        that did not look like a site. They added a prefers
                        reduced motion. After they finished the presentation we
                        had some drinks and food.

                    <h2>Conclusion: what I learned</h2>
                    <p>
                        Q42 seems like a very interesting company. Their main
                        focus is creating something with tech, design they let
                        another company do. What they showed us tody is that you
                        can be a development bureau and still put focus on
                        accessibility for different products.
