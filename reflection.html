                    <h2>My final reflection of the Meesterproef</h2>
                    <p>
                        During meesterproef i worked in a team for the Tumi
                        Mundo project. It was a fun project to do. The team was
                        great, the clients were kind and passionate about the
                        project. I contributed significantly to the project
                        through generating idea's and through code. The things
                        i'm most proud of are the attention test itself. I
                        worked on this part of site for a few weeks which turned
                        out great. Another part i worked on was the
                        customization page. On this page i have challenged
                        myself my using less Javascript and more of Sveltekit's
                        own functionalities which reduced the amount of code in
                        the file. It was an honor to be working in such a team.
                        I really admire other peoples talents and how much room
                        you're given to experiment around a bit. We were very
                        supportive of each other throughout the project. There
                        was room to reach our personal goals and adjustments of
                        the projects so each member could reach their personal
                        goals. Working with the clients Roy and Jaap was great.
                        They were very kind clients that told us and made us
                        feel like professionals. They have encouraged us to not
                        just ask for their approval all the time, but to also
                        suggest ideas based on our own expertise in this field.
                    </p>
                    <h2>My goals</h2>
                    <p>
                        During this meesterproef i had assigned myself 3 goals
                        to work on during the meesterproef: 1. Communicate
                        better, 2. get better with javascript and 3. experiment
                        more.
                    </p>
                    <h3>1. Communicate better</h3>
                    <p>
                        I wanted to learn to communicate better. The reason for
                        that is because i tend to put myself a lot in the
                        background. This time i wanted to try to put myself more
                        to the foreground by sharing my thought more. I think i
                        did alright on this during the meesterproef. I did good
                        on this. I shared my thought a bit more and ended up
                        taking the lead with Sena during one of our
                        presentations to the clients. This was pretty never
                        wrecking moment for me. But fortunately it went well.
                    </p>
                    <h3>2. Get better with Javascript</h3>
                    <p>
                        I wanted to learn to get better with Javascript,
                        especially the logics of how to solve a certain
                        Javascript problem. Without relying too much on things
                        like ChatGPT and Google. Looking on little Javascript
                        things is fine and also it's pretty normal for coding
                        but i really want to learn to try to make come up with
                        solutions myself to bigger problems, so i feel like it's
                        me that's writing it and feeling like an actual coder.
                        It could also help me better understand Javascript. So
                        during the meesterproef it worked on a lot of javascript
                        while building the attention test. Like creating the
                        timer to the test i tried to do it myself as much as
                        possible. Which did cause me to finish thing
                        significantly slower but i felt like i did learn more by
                        it.
                    </p>
                    <h3>3. Experiment more</h3>
                    <p>
                        I wanted to experiment more, because i've heard people
                        say that i tend to play things too save. I don't really
                        dare to experiment a lot because of the fear of
                        underestimating the difficulty of things. Which might
                        cause for me to get stuck at one thing for too long and
                        barely make any progress. So i tend to stick as much as
                        possible to what i know and what i already can do while
                        only trying new things to a minimal. So during this
                        minor I tried to be more aware of this and tell myself
                        to try new things when possible. And well... this
                        certainly happened. Working with attention test
                        functionality, understanding the API, using Sveltekit
                        functionalities were all new things to me. I'm glad that
                        afterwards i can look back and say it wasn't that bad.
                    </p>
                    <h2>The minor</h2>
                    <p>
                        Overall the minor was great! I learned a lot of new
                        things about css and got inspired to make nice looking
                        interaction rich websites because of the speakers that
                        showed up and some made really amazing things. My
                        favorite speaker is still Kilian because he gave us
                        practical tips about some handy html, css features that
                        are instantly useful to us. The talks about people
                        talking about their hobbies i found less interesting
                        because it doesn't speak to me at all. Another subject i
                        found interesting were the ones about accessibility,
                        especially the one from Fenna de Wilde. She gave some
                        really interesting details on code level about
                        accessibility.
                    </p>
                    <h2>What i bring with me after the minor</h2>
                    <p>
                        Use more html and css instead of Javascript whenever
                        possible. If things can be made by using the browsers
                        built in things, then it's better to use that than to
                        use javascript library. I also want to continue learning
                        more about the possibilities of css and it's newest
                        features since this has been taking of the last couple
                        of years. Accessibility is another one i want to focus
                        on whenever possible. Checking for the basics like
                        contrast, font-size and if a project allows it testing
                        with screen reader. I hope to continue growing on these
                        area's and many more during later projects.
