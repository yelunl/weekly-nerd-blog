          <h2>What are my goals (talk 2)</h2>

          <h3>Weekly nerd guests</h3>
          <p>
            So far I really enjoyed the talks exploring about what is possible
            with Css. It makes me want to explore a bit more in this area and
            start experimenting. Accessibly was also really interesting. I only
            wished some talks could go a little bit more deeper into the
            subject. These were very interesting.
          </p>

          <h3>Hackathon</h3>
          <p>
            The
            <a href="https://lynnwolters.github.io/css-day-hackathon/"
              >hackathon</a
            >
            went well i was on a team with Lisa Lynn and Eefje. We created a
            site where you can see the most viewed talks each year and created a
            detailed page about it. My job was creating a summary and a demo for
            the detailed pages and a couple of animations in the detail page.
            Unfortunately due to a huge merge conflict in the end our website
            didn't fully work.
          </p>

          <h3>Reflection</h3>
          <p>
            It's all going well for now. I learned a lot about Css and a lot
            about accessibility. These subjects are very interesting to me
            during this minor. Css to the rescue was the subject where i learned
            a lot of new and exciting things like :has() that i still use on
            other projects.
            <a href="https://github.com/yelunl/CssToTheRescue">Css</a> was a bit
            hard to learn and my site ended up looking a bit simple.
            <a href="yelunl.github.io/BrowserTech/">Browser tech</a> was my
            least favorite subject. The most challenging part was the show and
            hide.
            <a href="https://yelunl.github.io/HCD/HCD4/index.html">Hcd</a> i
            learned to test and create a website exclusively for one person with
            a disability. I'm happy with how these tests went.
            <a href="api-2324-rvtq.onrender.com">Api</a> was very challenging. I
            changed concept half way and i couldn't do a lot of the things i
            wanted to do. So the site was a little blank, but i was still happy
            with it. Only thing i'm really bad at during each subject is design
            and creating a good idea/concept for projects.

          <h3>My goals</h3>
          <p>
            My 3 goals for the mastertrial are: Learn to work better in a team,
            experiment more (with css) and get better with Javascript.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Learn to work better in a team
              <p>
                I want to be able to communicate better within a team and learn
                to put myself more into the foreground. Give more of my own
                input into projects.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              Experiment more (with css)
              <p>
                I want to dare to experiment more. I do get alot of feedback in
                the past that i tend to play things a bit safe. By trying out
                different things i hope i can get more creative and get better
                in css.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              Get better with Javascript
              <p>
                I want to be able to write my own Javascript. Mostly because i
                tend to Google too much on how to do anything. So want to
                practice the logic behind my own project more without relying
                too much on Google.
