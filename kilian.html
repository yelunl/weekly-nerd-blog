      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>
        Today's lecture is was all about using HTML and CSS as much as you can
        without using too much JavaScript. Because the browser is built with
        HTML, it has many built in features that a lot of developers would try
        to built with Javascript. The benefits of using HTML over Javascript is
        that HTML also has built in accessibility features and do not require an
        endless list of packages and node modules. During this lecture, Kilian
        Valkhof talked about many different ways one can built features using
        only HTML and CSS.

            To create a toggle element one can use checkbox and design it into a

      <h2>What I learned</h2>
      <p>
        There are many different ways to create features that only use HTML
        instead of JavaScript. There are many benefits to using HTML and CSS
        over JavaScript. What I learned is to always use basic HTML and CSS to
        get something done. If not possible then use Javascript. There are many
        tags and features that i didn't know existed in HTML so it was certainly
        an eye opener. I would look out for doing things with HTML and CSS more
        whenever I can, and when not possible I would use JavaScript.
