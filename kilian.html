          <h2>Summary of Kilian's lecture</h2>
          <blockquote>
            Rule of least power: choose the least powerful language suitable for
            a given purpose.
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            Today's lecture is was all about using HTML and CSS as much as you
            can without using too much JavaScript. Because the browser is built
            with HTML, it has many built in features that a lot of developers
            would try to built with Javascript. The benefits of using HTML over
            Javascript is that HTML also has built in accessibility features and
            do not require an endless list of packages and node modules. During
            this lecture, Kilian Valkhof talked about many different ways one
            can built features using only HTML and CSS.

              <p>
                To create a toggle element one can use checkbox and design it

            <li>
              <h3>Data list and options</h3>
              <p>
                It's a way that when user types in a text field, options show

              <p>
                When user clicks on a link which leads to another heading of the
                page, it scrolls smoothly instead instance. “Scroll-behaviour:

              <h3>Accordion</h3>
              <p>
                Use 'detail' and 'summary' to make accordion. Can also use the
                ::marker to change the triangle. Keep all the accordions open
                when user clicks to open another accordion.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Dialog</h3>
              <p>
                Use dialog html to make an alert message. To blur the background
                when dialog is open use ::backdrop

            <li>
              <h3>Select list</h3>
              <p>
                Uses 'selectList' and 'option' elements. Works like 'select' but
                better.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>

          <h2>Conclusion: what I learned</h2>
          <p>
            There are many different ways to create features that only use HTML
            instead of JavaScript. There are many benefits to using HTML and CSS
            over JavaScript. What I learned is to always use basic HTML and CSS
            to get something done. If not possible then use Javascript. There
            are many tags and features that i didn't know existed in HTML so it
            was certainly an eye opener. I would look out for doing things with
            HTML and CSS more whenever I can, and when not possible I would use
            JavaScript.
