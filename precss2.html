                    <p>
                        Miriam talked about css containment. They way we size
                        our elements can be intrinsic sized or outside.
                        Intrinsic is trickier to size than outside. She talked
                        about all the possibilities of being able to use
                        container to style. Now we can already use container
                        queries and style so the possibilities could be endless.
                        if developers want to continue build on it.

                    <h2>Conclusion: what I learned</h2>
                    <p>
                        It seems interesting, but i don't really understand when
                        it comes to changing the layout. One always needs to
                        resize the window in order to resize the container. It
                        feels a bit redundant.
