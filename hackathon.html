          <h2>Summary of Hackathon</h2>

          <p>
            I was in a team together with Lynn, Lisa en Eefje. Our job was to
            make a website using the data from Css day in the last couple of
            years. Our first idea was to make a website with all the most
            impactful talks each year in css. We asked Sanne to help us out with
            that. We then had a list of all the impactful talks. But we realized
            it's very subjective so we changed it to the most talks with the
            most views each year. Each talk needs to have it own page with a
            summary of the talks. Each year is represented with a little blob
            character. We had to watch each talk. But we realized that watching
            each talk takes around an hour and doing that for all the talks
            would be very time consuming. So we only created the full page for 2
            sites. We spend most of our times in figma to design the website. We
            were a little behind so we had to quickly start coding. My job was
            to watch 2 talks and make a summary for the detail page. And I made
            a short demo of the talk to showcase it on the detail page. And I
            helped with creating the animation of our characters on the detail
            page. Unfortunately we had did't make it in time. After we started
            to merge all out versions together our project broke. Many things in
            our project didn't work anymore.

          <h2>Conclusion: what I learned</h2>
          <p>
            Merge more often instead of waiting till the end. We spend too much
            time on the design and started very late with our code. We needed
            better time management. But the design did look nice and what we
            were able to create looked good.
