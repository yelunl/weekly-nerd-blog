                        Bramus is a web developer from Belgium. He works as a
                        Chrome Developer Relations Engineer at Google. Today he
                        talks about view transitions.

                    <h2>Summary of Bramus's lecture</h2>

                    <p>
                        Bramus talked about view transitions. Which is a new web
                        api which you can transition between 2 element. He
                        talked about how to use this on a single page
                        application. He gave a step by step guide starting from
                        very easy view transition to more complex ways of
                        defining page transitions adding pseudo classes. Then he
                        kinda lost me. But the view transitions api was really
                        interesting.

                    <h2>Conclusion: what I learned</h2>
                    <p>
                        The view transitions seems really interesting to me. It
                        is something i want to try out and experiment with. I
                        find the transition for multi page certainly
                        interesting, because it's something i thought was always
                        a bit impossible to do.
